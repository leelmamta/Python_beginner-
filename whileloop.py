# in function , loops , conditional statements indentation plays important 
mamta = 'happy'
count =0
while mamta=='happy': # while the condition under while loop is true it will run under its indentation 
    print("mamta is happy")
    count= count +1
    if count==5: # until count<5 mamta == "happy" if count ==5 mamta is assigned as sad how the while loop breaks
        mamta = 'sad'
    #run under this
